## Introduction

This document describes the design and implementation of a Prometheus alerts handler written in Golang. The alerts handler is responsible for receiving alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager, processing the received alerts, and taking appropriate actions based on the alert information.

## Requirements

1. The handler must be implemented in Golang.
2. The handler should receive alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager via HTTP POST requests.
3. The handler should be able to process alerts based on their severity and other attributes.
4. The handler should support extensibility to add more alert processing mechanisms in the future.
5. The handler should be tested to ensure proper functionality.

## System Architecture

The Prometheus alerts handler will be a standalone HTTP server, listening for incoming alert notifications from Prometheus Alertmanager. The server will process the alerts and take appropriate actions based on their attributes.

## API Design

The API will consist of a single POST endpoint to receive alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager:
POST /alerts

### Request

The request body should be a JSON array containing one or more alert objects, as defined by Prometheus Alertmanager. Each alert object contains the following attributes:

- `status`: The alert status (either "firing" or "resolved").
- `labels`: Key-value pairs containing alert labels (such as "severity", "instance", and "job").
- `annotations`: Key-value pairs containing alert annotations (such as "summary" and "description").

### Response

The response will be a JSON object containing the following attributes:

- `status`: A string indicating the result of processing the request ("success" or "error").
- `message`: A string containing a human-readable message describing the result of processing the request.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up the Golang project, including necessary dependencies (such as Gorilla Mux for routing and Logrus for logging).
2. Implement the main function to start the HTTP server and configure the required routes.
3. Implement the `/alerts` endpoint to receive and parse incoming alerts.
4. Implement the alert processing logic based on the alert attributes.
5. Implement logging and error handling.
6. Add support for extensibility to handle different types of alerts in the future.
7. Write unit tests to ensure the proper functionality of the handler.
8. Package the application and create a Dockerfile for easy deployment.

## Testing

The Prometheus alerts handler should be tested to ensure proper functionality. The following testing steps should be performed:

1. Unit testing: Write unit tests for the various components of the handler, including alert processing logic, endpoint handlers, and utility functions.
2. Integration testing: Test the handler against a running instance of Prometheus Alertmanager, sending various types of alerts to ensure correct processing and handling.
3. Performance testing: Measure the performance of the handler under load to ensure it can handle a high volume of alerts without degrading performance.
4. Security testing: Test the handler for potential security vulnerabilities and apply necessary security best practices to harden the application.
